## Cloud Research

Azure AZ104 Learning

I thought I would switch it up again today and move back onto the MS Learn AZ104 renewed Modules and worked my way through the Configure and Manage Virtual Networks for Azure Admins modules.

Split accross 12 individual modules:
*Configure the network for your virtual machines
*Design an IP addressing schema for your Azure deployment
*Host your domain on Azure DNS
*Distribute your services across Azure virtual networks and integrate them by using virtual network peering
*Manage and control traffic flow in your Azure deployment with routes
*Connect your on-premises network to Azure with VPN Gateway
*Connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft global network by using ExpressRoute
*Secure and isolate access to Azure resources by using network security groups and service endpoints
*Load balance your web service traffic with Application Gateway
*Improve application scalability and resiliency by using Azure Load Balancer
*Troubleshoot inbound network connectivity for Azure Load Balancer
*Monitor and troubleshoot your end-to-end Azure network infrastructure by using network monitoring tools

Some great information!
