# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[9/100]

## Cloud Research

Sections 5 & 6 of DevOps for Dummies completed, this brings me to the end of the book!
Some fantastic learnings of DevOps and complete with some Top Ten lists, one for why DevOps matters and Top 10 Pitfalls!
Read my blog for more details and overview of these sections!

Really happy to have completed this book. I have an Azure Exam next week (AZ-104), so I think I will spend the next few days revising some of the Exam questions and brishing up on some of the areas I haven't looked at in a while!
