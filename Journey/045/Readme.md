# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[45/100]

## Cloud Research

Final Day of the Azure DevOps Open Hack with Microsoft. A fantastic 3 days of intensive learning through doing activities and excersizes that has helped demystify the DevOps CI/CD pipelines to an extent that I am really excited about getting more hands on in my work.
