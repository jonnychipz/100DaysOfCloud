# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[13/100]

## Cloud Research

Today I spent some time getting my VSCode and Visual Studio configuration configured with the requirements to properly run Terraform. Involved uninstaling and resetting up my platform with the relevant extensions.

Ran through the basics of Terraform to prove all was working ok, so felt that I would blog about this and created a basic Resource Group creation Terraform script as prctice and test.
