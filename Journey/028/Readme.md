# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[28/100]

## Cloud Research

A few hours spent examining the Automation options within Azure using Serverless technologies. A quick write up on Azure Funcitons, WebJobs, Power Automate and Logic Apps.

Still huge more to learn across these 4 funciton areas, but a nice start to these learnings!
