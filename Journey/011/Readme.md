# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[11/100]

## Cloud Research

Smart Cities continues

Section 1 of my Smart Cities for Dummies book completed and findings and notes documented.

Ive decided to move off the into the beaten track of more theary and learning behind the Smart City concepts in technology. Mainly so I can try and lear to apply my technical knowledge in a pragmatic and practical way. Hopefully I can share my knowledge and inspre others in my peer group!

See my blog for more information!
