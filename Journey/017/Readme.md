# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[17/100]

## Cloud Research

Another big day today! The Welsh Azure User Group Virtual Meeting.

I hosted and spoke at my first virtual User group session with huge support form my fellow User group runners nd Microsoft. Learnt a load from the other guest speakers, Chris Whitehead talked aorund Enterprise Scale, and Richard Griffiths talked around Azure Blueprints.

Had a fab time organising it with the team and running through the sessions. Take a look at the links below and my blog for more information!
