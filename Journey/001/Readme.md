# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[1/100]

## Cloud Research

Hi all, ok so today is my first day of the 100DaysOfCloud Challenge. I spent  alittle while reading up on all the rules and joinging the Discord channel. I now have my VSCode Git repo all cloned and set up ready to keep track of this exciting Journey!

I created my first Blog post on 100DaysOfCode, Im not too sure if Im going to create a blog article for each day.... I may just do that and reference them in here each time, but hey we will see how I get on!

Anyhow, really excited to get started, and being an Azure guy, Im sure my bias will show through, but Id like to think I can get onto the AWS/Oracle and GCloud tracks a bit more as well!

Lots of great content to get stuck into! If anyone has something nice to start me off, then Im all ears, otherwise lets see what happens tomorrow!
