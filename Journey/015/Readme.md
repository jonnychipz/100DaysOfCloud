## Cloud Research

Azure AZ104 Learning

I thought I would keep on the MS Learn AZ104 renewed Modules and worked my way through the Deploy and manage Azure Compute resources modules.

Split accross 14 individual modules:
*Create a Linux virtual machine in Azure
*Create a Windows virtual machine in Azure
*Manage virtual machines with the Azure CLI
*Add and size disks in Azure virtual machines
*Secure your Azure virtual machine disks
*Keep your virtual machines updated
*Build Azure Resource Manager templates
*Deploy Azure virtual machines from VHD templates
*Build a scalable application with virtual machine scale sets
*Protect your virtual machine settings with Azure Automation State Configuration
*Deploy and run a containerized web app with Azure App Service
*Scale an App Service web app to efficiently meet demand with App Service scale up and scale out
*Run Docker containers with Azure Container Instances
*Introduction to Azure Kubernetes Service

Some great information on Compute respurces in Azure and definately some changes since I last properly studies these offerings. Especially enjoying the ocntent around containers and AKS.
