# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[6/100]

## Cloud Research

A nice overvierview of Azure NetApp Files (ANF) as well as a brief overview of the NetApp Virtual Desktop Service management platform from WVD deployments.

Really interesting session and learned a bit around the Azure NetApp Files service.
