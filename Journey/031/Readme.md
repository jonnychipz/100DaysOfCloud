## Cloud Research

Azure Communicaitons Services - Public Preview

ACS was announced at this years Virtual Microsoft Ignite sessions. Being inthe communicaitons space, this was of particular interest to me in terms of what is happening in the PSTN space, so I thought I would look at the integraiton options with using ACS and wrote my blog about it!

Fantastic to see the capabilities expanding and what this may mean for applicaiton development in the future!!! Exciting times and great things to learn about!
