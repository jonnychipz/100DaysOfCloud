# Jonnychipz 100DaysOfCloud Day[12/100]

## Cloud Research

Azure AZ104 Learning

I thought I would switch it up a bit today and move onto the MS Learn AZ104 renewed Modules and worked my way through the Managine Identities and Governance module.

This was a fun experience to refresh old knowledge and learn a few new tips and tricks especially around Cost Management as this is an area I don't tend to put much focus on currently. I think I will be moving forward!
