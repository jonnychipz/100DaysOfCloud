## Jonnychipz's Cloud Journey

Hi Everyone my name is John Lunn, I work as a Technical Architect and have been working with Microsoft Azure in anger since around late 2017, I have predominently been focussed on M365 especially in the UC space, but have started to focus far more on Azure and the Cloud adoption journey.

I found this challenge on Azure Fridays and thought I might give it a go as I am looking to brush off my old developer skillset and bring it up to speed with the modern day and Cloud. I am hoping to work towards AZ-400 DevOps Exam as well as learning a new language in Python and working with Terraform to work on great new Cloud solutions!

Really looking forward to getting started with this journey and hope to meed some likeminded folk along the way! Always happy to have a chat so please do reach out to me if you would like to!
